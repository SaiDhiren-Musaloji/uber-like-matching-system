# Distributed Locking Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the implementation of distributed locking to prevent race conditions and double-bookings in concurrent systems.

---

##  *Day 1-2: Introduction to Distributed Locking*

**Learning Objectives*
- Understand race conditions in distributed systems
- Learn Redis-based distributed locking patterns
- Implement atomic driver booking operations
- Handle lock timeouts and deadlocks

**What You'll Build*
- Redis-based distributed lock service
- Atomic driver booking endpoint
- Lock timeout and cleanup mechanisms
- Concurrency testing tools

**Theory (45 mins)*
Read these to understand the concepts:
- [Redis Distributed Locks](https://redis.io/docs/manual/patterns/distributed-locks/)
- [Race Conditions in Distributed Systems](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html)
- [Atomic Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems))
- [CAP Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)

**Hands-On Exercise (120 mins)*

#### *Step 1: Understand the Problem*
```bash
# Start your Week 2 system
npm start

# In two terminals, try to book the same driver simultaneously
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"driver_id": 1, "rider_id": 1, "pickup_lat": 40.7128, "pickup_lng": -74.0060}'

# This will cause race conditions without locking!
```

#### *Step 2: Manual Redis Lock Testing*
```bash
# Connect to Redis CLI
docker exec -it uber_redis redis-cli

# Test basic locking
SET lock:driver:1 "process-123" EX 30 NX
GET lock:driver:1

# Try to acquire same lock (should fail)
SET lock:driver:1 "process-456" EX 30 NX

# Release lock
DEL lock:driver:1
```

#### *Step 3: Implement Lock Service*
Create a distributed lock service using Redis.

**Testing (45 mins)*
- Test lock acquisition and release
- Test lock timeout behavior
- Test concurrent lock attempts
- Verify atomic operations

**Reflection (30 mins)*
Answer these questions:
1. What happens when two processes try to book the same driver?
2. How do we prevent deadlocks?
3. What if a process crashes while holding a lock?

##  *Day 3-4: Implement Atomic Booking System*

**Learning Objectives*
- Implement atomic driver booking operations
- Create ride request and matching system
- Handle booking state transitions
- Implement proper error handling

**What You'll Build*
- Booking API endpoints
- Atomic booking operations
- State management for rides
- Comprehensive error handling

**Theory (30 mins)*
- [ACID Properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)
- [Two-Phase Commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol)
- [Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)#Types)

**Hands-On Exercise (120 mins)*

#### *Step 1: Create Booking Tables*
Add booking and ride tables to PostgreSQL.

#### *Step 2: Implement Lock Service*
Create Redis-based distributed locking.

#### *Step 3: Implement Booking Endpoints*
- POST /api/bookings - Create booking request
- POST /api/bookings/:id/accept - Driver accepts booking
- POST /api/bookings/:id/cancel - Cancel booking
- GET /api/bookings/:id - Get booking status

#### *Step 4: Add Concurrency Testing*
Create scripts to test concurrent operations.

**Testing (30 mins)*
- Test single booking flow
- Test concurrent booking attempts
- Test lock timeout scenarios
- Test error recovery

**Reflection (30 mins)*
Answer these questions:
1. How do we ensure atomicity across multiple operations?
2. What happens if Redis fails during a booking?
3. How do we handle partial failures?

##  *Day 5: Advanced Concurrency Patterns*

**Learning Objectives*
- Implement optimistic locking
- Add retry mechanisms
- Handle high-concurrency scenarios
- Monitor and debug locking issues

**What You'll Build*
- Optimistic locking implementation
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Performance monitoring
- Comprehensive testing suite

**Theory (30 mins)*
- [Optimistic Concurrency Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control)
- [Exponential Backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)
- [Circuit Breaker Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html)

**Hands-On Exercise (120 mins)*

#### *Step 1: Implement Optimistic Locking*
Add version-based optimistic locking for driver updates.

#### *Step 2: Add Retry Mechanisms*
Implement exponential backoff for failed operations.

#### *Step 3: Create Performance Monitoring*
Add metrics for lock acquisition times and success rates.

#### *Step 4: Stress Testing*
Create comprehensive stress tests for concurrent operations.

**Testing (30 mins)*
- Stress test with 100+ concurrent requests
- Test lock contention scenarios
- Test system recovery from failures
- Monitor performance metrics

**Reflection (30 mins)*
Answer these questions:
1. When should we use optimistic vs pessimistic locking?
2. How do we handle lock contention?
3. What metrics should we monitor?
